# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

domain.com, www.domain.com {
        # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
        reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}

d.domain.com {
        reverse_proxy localhost:3000
        rewrite * ?direct=true
}

g.domain.com {
        reverse_proxy localhost:3000
        rewrite * ?gallery=true
}
